# AST-Flask
AST-Flask is the brain behind PalAST, it's a Flask-based web service that enables its user to upload an image of antibiotics placed in a bacterial sample, process it, and return the list of antibiotics that were placed on the sample, its label, and its perimeter. 

Have a nice look at the app in action:
